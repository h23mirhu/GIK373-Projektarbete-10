                        <b>Sweden has around 87 billion trees,</b> and 70 percent of its surface is covered with forests, according to Swedish Forest Industries (2024). This makes the forest industry one of Sweden’s most important business sectors. Sweden has a rich experience in managing diverse landscapes and forests efficiently through informed, effective governance. Having laws and environmental objectives addressing many areas of SDG 15 (United Nations, n.d.).
                        <br><br>
                        <b>It is claimed by the Swedish</b> Forest Industries (2024) that environmental and production goals in forestry have been balanced and given equal importance. Even though there is a one percent felling of forests annually, for every tree harvested, at least two are planted, making growth outpace the felling. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Despite these claims, Sweden experiences the most</b> forest loss out of all the EU countries. In a study published in the journal Earth’s Future by Ahlström et al. (2022), old and previously uncut Swedish forests are cut at a steady rate of approximately 1.4 percent between the years 2003 and 2019. This number is almost equivalent to the rate stated in Swedish Forest Industries (2024), though contrastingly Ahlström et al. (2022) do not see the solution in replantation. These forests are slow-developing and have distinct structural and ecological characteristics, which means retrieving them would take centuries.

Another thing to note is that Statistics Sweden (2022) and SDGs API (2025) show data from a different as well as longer time span than Ahlström et al.'s (2022) study. The cause of the forest area loss seen in both Statistics Sweden (2022) and SDGs API (2025) might not be only caused by clear-cuts; it can be caused by other factors such as natural occurrences.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>The chart shows the average annual</b> felling volume of each region in Sweden from the years 2000 until 2020. It is clear from the chart that Götaland has the biggest felling volume per year compared to the other regions, with Svealand being the second.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Combining the values from the north,</b> Upper Norrland and Lower Norrland, the average annual felling volume in Norrland is around 31.8 million forest cubic meters (m&sup3;sk), while in Götaland it is around 30.5 million forest cubic meters (m&sup3;sk).

                        <b>Swedish Forest Industries (2024) provides some</b> information about tree growth in Sweden. It is said that a typical growth cycle of a forest is between 60 and 100 years. It is also said that trees in southern Sweden grow twice as much faster as trees in the northern parts. In another article by Swedish Forest Industries (2024), it is claimed that tree growth outpaces felling.  
                        <br><br>
                        <b>By showing data from SLU Riksskogstaxeringen (2025)</b> in a chart of Sweden’s forest average annual volume increase in each region, the growth compared to the felling can be investigated.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>The chart shows that Götaland has</b> the biggest average annual growth volume compared to the other regions. Though comparing the north with the south, summing Upper Norrland’s and Lower Norrland’s growth volume making the north's average annual total growth volume around 53 million forest cubic meters (m&sup3;sk). The north has a higher average annual growth volume than the south, which is around 36 million forest cubic meters (m&sup3;sk).

                        <b>Comparing the average annual growth volume</b> to the average annual felling, it is clear, like Swedish Forest Industries (2024) claimed, that growth outpaces the felling. In northern Sweden the average annual growth outpaces the felling by 40 percent and in southern Sweden by 15 percent. The data from SLU Riksskogstaxeringen (2025) shows more growth in volume in the northern areas, though it does not give an insight into the growth speed of trees in each region.  
                        <br><br>
                        <b>According to the study by Fassl et al. (2024),</b> Nothern Sweden contains the largest protected forests in the country. The study also shows an increased growth of the two tree species, Scots pine and downy birch, in a northern forest reserve, particularly in the recent decades. It is also noted that increasing temperatures, caused by climate change, in the northern parts have a positive impact on the species Scots pine. This could explain the significant difference in forest growth volume in the northern areas compared to the southern areas.
